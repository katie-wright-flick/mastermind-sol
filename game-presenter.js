Welcome to Flick Mastermind ðŸ˜Ž

Your adversary has encoded some valuable information using a secret - it's your
job to guess it!

  ????

The secret is four characters long, and consists of any of the following 8
letters:

A B C D E F G H

When you submit a guess, you get a hint back:
- If one of your letters is correct, the hint will contain a X

- If one of your letters is correct but in the wrong position, the hint will
  contain a O

- The position of the X and O in the hint does not necssarily match the position of
  the guessed letter. (i.e. for a secret "AABC", if your guess was "CADB" then
  "XO--" would be the hint)

Good luck!
